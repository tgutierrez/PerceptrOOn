# PerceptrOOn

This is a toy implementation of a Perceptron Neural Network on C# using a Directed Graph approach instead of the classical matrix based code.

This is also a very inneficient and memory/cpu consuming architecture, but IMHO, it's a more intuitive approach for people (like me) that are just starting to learn Neural Networks, as it puts the "network" in Neural Network.

Future Enhancements:

- A way to serialize / deserialize the network, so weights can be distributed. 
- A UI to visualize nodes, weights and (ideally) the training process.
- A UI to visualize the content of the hidden layers
